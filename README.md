### Basic Proram Information
The goal of *Smart Tracker-List Generator* is to easily, and quickly, create a list of working and speedy trackers which anyone can use for their torrents via uTorrent, Qbittorrent, or any other torrent program. 

So what's *Smart Tracker-List Generator* do? The program downloads multiple trackers lists from Github repos and other sources (all of which are lists that are updated frequently), combines trackers from every list into a master-tracker list, and then will go through the master-tracker list, checking each tracker, and will remove a tracker if it: 
  - isn't running (assumed not running if a ping times out after 3 requests, or responds but has a ping over 7500ms).
  - is blacklisted on a credible malware/abuse database.

### Development & Installation
